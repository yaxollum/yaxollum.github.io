I have created 6 tutorials about various Java and computer science topics. The first 3 tutorials (Arrays, ArrayList, and Recursion) provide knowledge which is used in some of the other tutorials.

This is the recommended order for studying the tutorials:

1. [Arrays](/tutorials/arrays.html)
2. [ArrayList](/tutorials/arraylist.html)
3. [Recursion](/tutorials/recursion.html)
4. [OOP](/tutorials/oop.html)
5. [Searching](/tutorials/searching.html)
6. [Sorting](/tutorials/sorting.html)
