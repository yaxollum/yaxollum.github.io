Hello! I'm Peter Ye, a 2nd year student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo ([here's my résumé](/PeterYe_resume.pdf)).

During my free time, I enjoy working on side projects, which you can all find on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/yaxollum). Some of my non-academic hobbies include running, hiking, ice skating, and floorball.
